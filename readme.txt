sforth3 - FORTH interpreter - tdwsl 2022

So, this time around I decided I'd like to make proper use of immediate words,
and I think I did that successfully. If I ever try again to make a FORTH
interpreter, I think that I'd like to lean less towards bytecode, and more
toward a VM. Perhaps I could even end up adding the 'CODE' word. Anyway, this
interpreter works fine, and the outer interpreter is a bit clearer than it was
before, on account of the immediate words.
